                    might benefit often don't have the means or expertise to build them. MAD Labs aims to provide
                    development work to non-profit groups to help them achieve their goals. As a student organization,
                    many of our projects serve the larger Austin community, other student orgs at UT Austin, or MAD
                    itself.</p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>I'm not sure if my app proposal would work for Labs. Who should I talk to?</dt>
                    <dd>We encourage you to submit with as much information as you have. We will reach out for
                        clarification if needed, and will respond promptly to let you know whether Labs can work on your
                        project.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>What are the obligations of a Labs member?</dt>
                    <dd>Be willing to learn, and be willing to mentor. Be available for monthly
                        meetings, and have time to make contributions on a regular basis.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>What does Labs look for in new developers?</dt>
                    <dd>Demonstrated experience in mobile development or a belligerent desire to learn, as
                        well as shared values.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>When will the developer interest form open?</dt>
                    <dd>Labs projects take varying amounts of coordination and planning before
                        development can begin, and the team roster fluctuates according to availability.
                        We collect interest forms only when we are confident that we have a project
                        ready for development.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>What if I become busy and can no longer contribute?</dt>
                    <dd>It happens. We ask members to give us as much advance notice as possible, and to mentor a new
                        developer if they can.
